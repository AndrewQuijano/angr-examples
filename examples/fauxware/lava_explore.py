class LAVAPrioritizingTechnique(et.ExplorationTechnique):
    """
    A custom Angr exploration technique designed to prioritize states (paths)
    during symbolic execution based on various heuristics, with a focus on
    finding 'hard-to-reach' branches, such as those guarded by specific
    string comparisons (like backdoors or magic values) or deeply nested conditions.

    This technique combines concepts from:
    1.  **Coverage-guided fuzzing/exploration:** Prioritizing states that discover new basic blocks.
        (Justification: This is a fundamental strategy in most modern fuzzers like AFL [1] and
        symbolic execution tools, as exploring new code is key to finding new vulnerabilities [2]).
    2.  **Targeted/Directed Symbolic Execution:** Prioritizing states that are moving closer to
        pre-defined target addresses (e.g., known backdoor functions, interesting memory locations).
        (Justification: Directed symbolic execution aims to reach specific code locations,
        often using heuristics like shortest path to target in the CFG [3, 4]).
    3.  **Constraint Analysis:** Prioritizing states that contain specific types of constraints,
        particularly those involving comparisons with known 'magic values' or string operations.
        (Justification: Symbolic execution's strength is in solving complex constraints. Explicitly
        targeting states with comparisons against known difficult-to-guess values (like passwords
        or protocol magic bytes) is a direct application of this strength,
        bypassing brute-force limitations of fuzzing [5]).
    4.  **Deep Path/Complex Branch Prioritization:** Favoring paths that have traversed more
        conditional branches or have a greater execution depth, which fuzzers typically
        struggle to achieve.
        (Justification: Fuzzers often get stuck in shallow paths. Symbolic execution can
        navigate complex control flow. Prioritizing deeper or more constrained paths helps
        uncover subtle bugs requiring specific sequences of decisions [3, 4]).

    Attributes:
        priority_targets (list[int]): A list of instruction addresses (integers) that this
                                      technique should prioritize reaching.
        magic_values (list[bytes]): A list of concrete byte strings (e.g., b"SOSNEAKY", b"KingRosa")
                                    that, if found in symbolic constraints (e.g., from strcmp),
                                    should increase a state's priority.
        covered_blocks (set): A set of basic block addresses that have been covered so far across
                              all explored paths. Used for new coverage prioritization.
        project (angr.Project): A reference to the Angr project, needed for CFG and symbol lookups.

        # that require specific sequences of decisions. This complements coverage-guided
